Program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

I'm making progress in my journey of learning programming with Java.
I must admit that I'm a complete beginner in this, and also with
English (as I'm a native Spanish speaker). However, I will keep learning
day by day, taking it one step at a time; there's no need to rush.
